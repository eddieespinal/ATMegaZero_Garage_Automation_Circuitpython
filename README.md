Please make sure to update `secrets.py` with your own credentials.

For this project I'm using all of my own products from [ATMegaZero](https://shop.atmegazero.com), but you can modify this code to use any circuitpython boards, sensors and relays.

## Material used in this project:
1. [ATMegaZero ESP32-S2 - (coming soon)](https://circuitpython.org/board/atmegazero_esp32s2/)
2. [ATMegaZero Sensors Shield](https://shop.atmegazero.com/products/atmegazero-sensors-shield-compatible-with-the-raspberry-pi)
3. [ATMegaZero Learning Shield](https://shop.atmegazero.com/products/atmegazero-learning-shield)
4. [ATMegaZero Relay Shield - (coming soon)](https://shop.atmegazero.com)
